======================

1.  Assumptions match well with the scope of the project. (We can probably
add more assumptions as time goes on but the ones we have are fine).
2.  "Do we want to update coordinate(s) during gameplay?" (I am pretty 
sure we have to.
3.  We need to draw a relationship between Playground and GameSession.
A relationship between these entities is missing.
4.  Change username in GameSession 
5.  Revisit the relationship between GameSession and Guild.	
6.  GameSession as the "center of the Universe" in our project.
7.  Closely rexamine plurals in the attributes (such as winners and losers).
8.  Do we need device_id (I am pretty sure we do).
